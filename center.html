                                                Systems Analysis and Design is an active field in which analysts repetitively learn new approaches and different techniques for building the system more effectively and efficiently. The primary objective of systems analysis and design is to improve organizational systems. This provides a basic understanding of system characteristics, system design, and its development processes. It is a good introductory guide that provides an overview of all the concepts necessary to build a system.

                                This will help budding software professionals to understand how a system is designed in a systematic and phased manner, starting from requirement analysis to system implementation and maintenance.
